          "message": "ci(bench): benchmark suite with tracked history (#876)\n\n`bun run bench` runs every *.bench.ts, one process each, and writes\ncustomSmallerIsBetter JSON. A shared harness warms up, times 51 runs and\nreports the fastest (tracked) and the median; budgets stay hard\nassertions. The four grants/catalog benches move into the suite.\n\nA workflow records history to gh-pages (dev/bench) on main and, on PRs,\ncomments and fails above 150% of the baseline. Docs in\ndocs/benchmarks.md.\n\nCo-authored-by: Claude Sonnet 5.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>",
